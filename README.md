## How It's Made:
A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). I have completed over 420+ challenges and push 5 solutions every week.


## Optimizations
I consistently re-examine and refactor my code to improve readability/code efficiency.


## Lessons Learned:
I learned that there are an endless amount of ways to solve a challenge and find a solution. Nonetheless, there is always room for improvement and learn from the solutions of fellow developers.
